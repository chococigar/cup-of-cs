## Why we're doing this
* To explain what we know / should know in our own words.
    * To face what we know vs. don't know.
* To understand things enough that we can hack / tweak / form opinions on stuffs.
* tl;dr, eli5.

## How to conduct a cup-of-cs
* This is a safe space. No such thing as stupid questions.
* Be casual and fun. As a rule, we include [ü§™emojis](https://emojipedia.org/) in all our titles.
* Everyone in cup-of-cs must present a topic on a round robin order.
    * The presenter should announce their topic/agenda a few days in advance, and ask the team for any questions.
    * Shoot for 30- minutes on the presentation. Save 10+ minutes for Q/A.
    * At the end of the presention, get feedback and pick the next presenter.
* Hold cup-of-cs periodically. (suggested: weekly, biweekly)
