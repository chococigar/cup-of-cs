## what we'll cover
1. Intro: what languages we've come across, and their characteristics
    - Why are there so many languages?
2. Key concepts of a programming language
3. Q&A
    - Answering previously asked questions

## 5 Major components of a CS language
// as defined by [Gary](https://youtu.be/GI_V3yzVDtA))
1. How it is run
2. Typing
3. Object-oriented vs. Functional
4. Garbage Collector
5. Concurrency

## Questions
1. What is the philosophical difference between Python and Javascript? (or Python and C++?)
2. Why does a language become trendy/popular? How did trends in Python/JS come about? What languages would be created in the future?
3. Python is popular in ML, but wasn’t the use-case when it was initially made.  Will there be a language with ML-specific use case?
4. What are pros and cons of an intermediate language (as opposed to compiled and interpreted?)
5. Are compilers OS-specific?
6. What’s llvm and why do compiler geeks like it?
7. Are Android apps JVM compatible? How does Java run in different environments?
8. How do I build my own CS language?
